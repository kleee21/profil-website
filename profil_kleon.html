        <h2>About Me</h2>
        </center>
        <p>Hi there! I’m Kleon Alfeus Effendi, a 14-year-old student currently studying at Talenta High School. I’ve always been drawn to music, and over the years, <i>playing the guitar has become a significant part of my life.</i> I love the feeling of getting lost in the melodies I create and the challenge of mastering new techniques and songs. Music, for me, is more than just a hobby; it’s a way to express emotions that words sometimes can’t capture. Whether I’m strumming my favorite tunes or experimenting with new sounds, the guitar allows me to tap into a deeper creative side. I’ve learned that music can bring people together, and I love the connection I feel when I play for friends or simply jam alone.

    <br> <br> When I’m not playing guitar, I enjoy immersing myself in all kinds of music, from rock and indie to classical and jazz. Discovering new artists and genres keeps me inspired and fuels my passion for music even more. I believe that music is a universal language that can evoke powerful emotions and tell stories in ways that nothing else can. Beyond just listening, I love analyzing how different elements come together to create something unique and impactful. I’m always eager to learn more, not just about playing instruments, but about music production, songwriting, and the different ways it influences people. Music will always be a central part of who I am, and I look forward to continuing this journey as I grow.</p>
